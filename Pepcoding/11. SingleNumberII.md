Solution : 

Need to watch sumeet sir's solution for this.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int threeN = -1;
        int threeNplus1 = 0;
        int threeNplus2 = 0;
        
        for(auto i : nums){
            int commonWithThreeN = threeN & i;
            int commonWithThreeNplus1 = threeNplus1 & i;
            int commonWithThreeNplus2 = threeNplus2 & i;
            
            threeN = threeN & (~commonWithThreeN);
            threeNplus1 = threeNplus1 | commonWithThreeN;
            
            threeNplus1 = threeNplus1 & (~commonWithThreeNplus1);
            threeNplus2 = threeNplus2 | (commonWithThreeNplus1);
            
            threeNplus2 = threeNplus2 & (~commonWithThreeNplus2);
            threeN = threeN | commonWithThreeNplus2;
        }
        return threeNplus1;
    }
};
