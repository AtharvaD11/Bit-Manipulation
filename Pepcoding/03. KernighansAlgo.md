Problem Statement : <br>
1. You are given a number n.<br>
2. You have to count the number of set bits in the given number.

### Solution : 

#### Kernighans Algorithm :
Brian Kernighanâ€™s algorithm is used to find the number of set bits in a number.<br> The idea behind the algorithm is that when we subtract one from an integer, all the bits following the rightmost set of bits are inverted, turning 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.<br> The rightmost set bit also gets inverted with the bits right to it.

Code : 

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int counter = 0;
    while(n){
        int rightmostSetBitMask = (n & -n);
        n -= rightmostSetBitMask;
        counter ++;
    }
    cout << counter << endl;
}

```
