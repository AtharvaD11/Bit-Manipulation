Problem Statement : 
1. You are given an integer N which represents the total number of soldiers standing in a circle 
     having position marked from 1 to N.<br>
2. A cruel king wants to execute them but in a different way.<br>
3. He starts executing soldiers from 1st position and proceeds around the circle in clockwise 
     direction.<br>
4. In each step, every second soldier is executed.<br>
5. The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the 
     executed soldiers are removed), until only the last soldier remains, who is given freedom.<br>
6. You have to find the position of that lucky soldier.

Solution : 

Here, we have to represent the n in the form of 2^x + l.

The answer then will be , 2*l + 1;

Check its proof on Numberphile.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int helper(int n){
    int i = 1;
    while(i * 2 <= n){
        i = i * 2;
    }
    return i;
}

int main(){
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    int nearestPowerOf2 = helper(n);
    int l = n - nearestPowerOf2;
    cout << 2 *l + 1 << endl;
}
```
