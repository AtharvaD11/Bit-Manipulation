Problem Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-words-for-each-puzzle/

Problem Statement : 

With respect to a given puzzle string, a word is valid if both the following conditions are satisfied:<br>
    word contains the first letter of puzzle.<br>
    For each letter in word, that letter is in puzzle.<br>
    For example, if the puzzle is "abcdefg", then valid words are "faced", "cabbage", and "baggage", whileinvalid words are "beefed" (does not include 'a') and "based" (includes 's'   which is not in the puzzle).<br>

Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the number of words in the given word list words that is valid with respect to the puzzle puzzles[i].

### Solution : BitMasking and Submask Enumeration

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findNumOfValidWords(vector<string>& words, vector<string>& puzzles) {
        unordered_map<int,int> wordMaskFreq;
        
        for(string &word : words){
            int wordMask = 0;
            for(char ch : word){
                int bit = ch - 'a';
                wordMask = wordMask |  (1 << bit);
            }
            wordMaskFreq[wordMask]++;
        }
        
        vector<int> ans;
        
        for(string &puzzle : puzzles){
            int puzzleMask = 0;
            for(char ch : puzzle){
                int bit = ch - 'a';
                puzzleMask = puzzleMask | (1 << bit);
            }
            
            int subMask = puzzleMask;
            int first = (1 << (puzzle[0]-'a'));
            int count = 0;
            while(subMask){
                if(subMask & first){
                    count+= wordMaskFreq[subMask];
                }
                subMask = ((subMask-1) &puzzleMask);
            }
            ans.push_back(count);
        }
        return ans;
