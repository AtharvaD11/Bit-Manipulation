Problem Statement : 

Given a number N. The task is to reduce the given number N to 1 in the minimum number of steps. You can perform any one of the below operations in each step.<br>

Operation 1: If the number is even then you can divide the number by 2.<br>
Operation 2: If the number is odd then you are allowed to perform either (n+1) or (n-1).<br>

You need to print the minimum number of steps required to reduce the number N to 1 by performing the above operations.

Solution : 

```
int countSteps(int n)
{
    int count = 0;
    while (n > 1) {
        count++;
 
        // num even, divide by 2
        if (n % 2 == 0)
            n /= 2;
 
        // num odd, n%4 == 1
        // or n==3(special edge case),
        // decrement by 1
        else if (n % 4 == 1||n==3)
            n -= 1;
 
        // num odd, n%4 == 3, increment by 1
        else
            n += 1;
    }
 
    return count;
}
```
